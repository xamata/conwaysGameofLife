NOTE: THIS IS NOT MY CODE, THIS IS FROM 'HOW TO AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON' By Al Sweigart. An amazing book for python beginners.

I uploaded this code with minor tweaks because I was very excited to learn how to write this program. I've watched documentarys on this program and to able to write it is a very huge milestone for me.At one point in time I thought it was impossible for me to understand. I will be looking back at this code as a reminder of how far I've come and how far I can go.
